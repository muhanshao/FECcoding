# FECcoding
This is a project of FEC Coding Techniques for High-speed Chip-to-Module Link.

We focused on 2 FEC codes, BCH and RS. We wrote functions to encode and decode messages and tested the bit error rate.

We embedded RS(528,514) code into high-speed SerDes serial link system and tested the performance.
